                I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. It takes dark in order to show light. Just make a decision and let it go. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Let's get wild today. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.
